            Autopolyploidy is taxonomically defined as the presence of more than two copies of each genome within an organism or species, where the genomes present must all originate within the same species. Alternatively, “genetic” or “cytological” autopolyploidy is defined by polysomic inheritance: random pairing and segregation of the four (or more) homologous chromosomes present, with no preferential pairing partners. In this review, we provide an overview of methods used to categorize species as taxonomic and cytological autopolyploids, including both modern and obsolete cytological methods, marker‐segregation‐based and genomics methods. Subsequently, we also investigated how frequently polysomic inheritance has been reliably documented in autopolyploids. Pure or predominantly polysomic inheritance was documented in 39 of 43 putative autopolyploid species where inheritance data was available (91\%) and in seven of eight synthetic autopolyploids, with several cases of more mixed inheritance within species. We found no clear cases of autopolyploids with disomic inheritance, which was likely a function of our search methodology. Interestingly, we found seven species with purely polysomic inheritance and another five species with partial or predominant polysomic inheritance that appear to be taxonomic allopolyploids. Our results suggest that observations of polysomic inheritance can lead to relabeling of taxonomically allopolyploid species as autopolyploid and highlight the need for further cytogenetic and genomic investigation into polyploid origins and inheritance types.},

              Premise
              A complicating factor in analyzing allopolyploid genomes is the possibility of physical interactions between homoeologous chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in either crossover (homoeologous exchanges) or non‐crossover products (homoeologous gene conversion). Homoeologous gene conversion was first described in cotton by comparing SNP patterns in sequences from two diploid progenitors with those from the allopolyploid subgenomes. These analyses, however, did not explicitly consider other evolutionary scenarios that may give rise to similar SNP patterns as homoeologous gene conversion, creating uncertainties about the reality of the inferred gene conversion events.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Here, we use an expanded phylogenetic sampling of high‐quality genome assemblies from seven allopolyploid
                Gossypium
                species (all derived from the same polyploidy event), four diploid species (two closely related to each subgenome), and a diploid outgroup to derive a robust method for identifying potential genomic regions of gene conversion and homoeologous exchange.
              
            
            
              Results
              We found little evidence for homoeologous gene conversion in allopolyploid cottons, and that only two of the 40 best‐supported events were shared by more than one species. We did, however, reveal a single, shared homoeologous exchange event at one end of chromosome 1, which occurred shortly after allopolyploidization but prior to divergence of the descendant species.
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Overall, our analyses demonstrated that homoeologous gene conversion and homoeologous exchanges are uncommon in
                Gossypium
                , affecting between zero and 24 genes per subgenome (0.0–0.065\%) across the seven species. More generally, we highlighted the potential problems of using simple four‐taxon tests to investigate patterns of homoeologous gene conversion in established allopolyploids.},

              Many commercially important plants are autopolyploid. As a result of the multiple chromosome sets in their genomes, higher orders of allele interactions can occur, implying different degrees of dominance. In contrast with diploids, dominance effects can be heritable in polyploids, potentially having a higher impact on the prediction of genetic values. In this study, we investigated the role of additive and dominance effects in the prediction of genotypic values for complex traits in autotetraploid species in the context of genomic selection. As autotetraploid model species, we used data from breeding populations of blueberry (
              Vaccinium
              spp.,
              n
               = 1804) and potato (
              Solanum tuberosum
              L.,
              n
               = 560), assessing genetic parameters and prediction ability of five and two horticultural traits, respectively. Using a Bayesian framework, the genotypic effects were estimated based on (i) realized additive and digenic dominance relationship matrices, and (ii) all markers included as explanatory variables under ridge regression and Bayes B approaches. When included, dominance effects explained part of the estimated genetic variance and resulted in better goodness‐of‐fit values. However, their predictive ability was similar to the predictability obtained with additive models. Although we have considered only autotetraploid species in this study, many of the ideas and results should be of more general interest, with applications in species with higher ploidy level.},

	abstract = {We modeled the behavior of recessive mutations with deleterious effects to either the sporophyte or the gametophyte, or both, in polysomic tetraploid populations by allowing for varying levels of double reduction, mutation, and self-fertilization. Double reduction causes a decrease of the equilibrium frequencies of deleterious alleles, and it has much more influence on genes subjected to gametophytic selection than on genes solely under sporophytic selection. With gametophytic selection, low frequencies of double reduction are enough to reduce equilibrium frequencies severalfold. Double reduction occurs when sister alleles migrate to the same gamete during meiosis. It depends on the frequency at which a locus recombines with its centromere, and on the frequency of multivalent formation. Therefore, a greater accumulation of deleterious mutations should occur on polysomic chromosomes with a prevalence of bivalent pairing and in chromosomal regions between centromeres and proximal chiasmata. Proximal loci should have a greater impact in reducing the fitness of a polyploid population being inbred. This prediction can explain observations that homozygosities at different subchromosomal regions have distinct effects on inbreeding depression in polyploids. Furthermore, even mildly deleterious alleles can lead to large amounts of inbreeding depression because of their high equilibrium frequencies. Molecular studies correlating level of heterozygosity and degree of heterosis should take into account this nonuniform distribution of deleterious alleles in polyploid genomes. Preservation or enhancement of heterozygosity would be more critical at proximal regions than at other chromosome regions in polysomic polyploid species.},

Although the prevalence of polyploidy in plants is well documented, the molecular and cytological consequences are understood largely from newly formed polyploids (neopolyploids) that have been grown experimentally. Classical cytological and molecular cytogenetic studies both have shown that experimental neoallopolyploids often have meiotic irregularities, producing chromosomally variable gametes and progeny; however, little is known about the extent or duration of chromosomal variation in natural neoallopolyploid populations. We report the results of a molecular cytogenetic study on natural populations of a neoallopolyploid,
              Tragopogon miscellus
              , which formed multiple times in the past 80 y. Using genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we uncovered massive and repeated patterns of chromosomal variation in all populations. No population was fixed for a particular karyotype; 76\% of the individuals showed intergenomic translocations, and 69\% were aneuploid for one or more chromosomes. Importantly, 85\% of plants exhibiting aneuploidy still had the expected chromosome number, mostly through reciprocal monosomy-trisomy of homeologous chromosomes (1:3 copies) or nullisomy-tetrasomy (0:4 copies). The extensive chromosomal variation still present after

            Dominance refers to the effect of a heterozygous genotype relative to that of the two homozygous genotypes. The degree of dominance of mutations for fitness can have a profound impact on how deleterious and beneficial mutations change in frequency over time as well as on the patterns of linked neutral genetic variation surrounding such selected alleles. Since dominance is such a fundamental concept, it has received immense attention throughout the history of population genetics. Early work from Fisher, Wright, and Haldane focused on understanding the conceptual basis for why dominance exists. More recent work has attempted to test these theories and conceptual models by estimating dominance effects of mutations. However, estimating dominance coefficients has been notoriously challenging and has only been done in a few species in a limited number of studies. In this review, we first describe some of the early theoretical and conceptual models for understanding the mechanisms for the existence of dominance. Second, we discuss several approaches used to estimate dominance coefficients and summarize estimates of dominance coefficients. We note trends that have been observed across species, types of mutations, and functional categories of genes. By comparing estimates of dominance coefficients for different types of genes, we test several hypotheses for the existence of dominance. Lastly, we discuss how dominance influences the dynamics of beneficial and deleterious mutations in populations and how the degree of dominance of deleterious mutations influences the impact of inbreeding on fitness.},

            Whole-genome duplication (polyploidization) is among the most dramatic mutational processes in nature, so understanding how natural selection differs in polyploids relative to diploids is an important goal. Population genetics theory predicts that recessive deleterious mutations accumulate faster in allopolyploids than diploids due to the masking effect of redundant gene copies, but this prediction is hitherto unconfirmed. Here, we use the cotton genus (Gossypium), which contains seven allopolyploids derived from a single polyploidization event 1–2 Million years ago, to investigate deleterious mutation accumulation. We use two methods of identifying deleterious mutations at the nucleotide and amino acid level, along with whole-genome resequencing of 43 individuals spanning six allopolyploid species and their two diploid progenitors, to demonstrate that deleterious mutations accumulate faster in allopolyploids than in their diploid progenitors. We find that, unlike what would be expected under models of demographic changes alone, strongly deleterious mutations show the biggest difference between ploidy levels, and this effect diminishes for moderately and mildly deleterious mutations. We further show that the proportion of nonsynonymous mutations that are deleterious differs between the two coresident subgenomes in the allopolyploids, suggesting that homoeologous masking acts unequally between subgenomes. Our results provide a genome-wide perspective on classic notions of the significance of gene duplication that likely are broadly applicable to allopolyploids, with implications for our understanding of the evolutionary fate of deleterious mutations. Finally, we note that some measures of selection (e.g., dN/dS, πN/πS) may be biased when species of different ploidy levels are compared.},

          Genotype data from tetraploid F1 populations are often collected in breeding programs for mapping and genomic selection purposes. A common quality control procedure in these groups is to compare empirical genotype frequencies against those predicted by Mendelian segregation, where SNPs detected to have “segregation distortion” are discarded. However, current tests for segregation distortion are insufficient in that they do not account for double reduction and preferential pairing, two meiotic processes in polyploids that naturally change gamete frequencies, leading these tests to detect segregation distortion too often. Current tests also do not account for genotype uncertainty, again leading these tests to detect segregation distortion too often. Here, we incorporate double reduction, preferential pairing, and genotype uncertainty in likelihood ratio and Bayesian tests for segregation distortion. Our methods are implemented in a user-friendly R package, menbayes. We demonstrate the superiority of our methods to those currently used in the literature on both simulations and real data.},

              Hardy–Weinberg proportions (HWP) are often explored to evaluate the assumption of random mating. However, in autopolyploids, organisms with more than two sets of homologous chromosomes, HWP and random mating are different hypotheses that require different statistical testing approaches. Currently, the only available methods to test for random mating in autopolyploids (i) heavily rely on asymptotic approximations and (ii) assume genotypes are known, ignoring genotype uncertainty. Furthermore, these approaches are all frequentist, and so do not carry the benefits of Bayesian analysis, including ease of interpretability, incorporation of prior information, and consistency under the null. Here, we present Bayesian approaches to test for random mating, bringing the benefits of Bayesian analysis to this problem. Our Bayesian methods also (i) do not rely on asymptotic approximations, being appropriate for small sample sizes, and (ii) optionally account for genotype uncertainty via genotype likelihoods. We validate our methods in simulations and demonstrate on two real datasets how testing for random mating is more useful for detecting genotyping errors than testing for HWP (in a natural population) and testing for Mendelian segregation (in an experimental S1 population).

              Chromosome rearrangements are common, but their dynamics over time, mechanisms of occurrence and the genomic features that shape their distribution and rate are still poorly understood. We used allohaploid
              Brassica napus

              n
               = 19) as a model to analyze the effect of genomic features on the formation and diversity of meiotically driven chromosome rearrangements. We showed that allohaploid
              B. napus
              meiosis leads to extensive new structural diversity. Almost every allohaploid offspring carried a unique combination of multiple rearrangements throughout the genome, and was thus structurally differentiated from both its haploid parent and its sister plants. This large amount of genome reshuffling was remarkably well‐tolerated in the heterozygous state, as neither male nor female fertility were strongly reduced, and meiosis behavior was normal in most cases. We also used a quantitative statistical model, which accounted for 75\% of the observed variation in rearrangement rates, to show that the distribution of meiotically driven chromosome rearrangements was not random but was shaped by three principal genomic features. In descending order of importance, the rate of marker loss increased strongly with genetic distance from the centromere, the degree of collinearity between chromosomes, and the genome of origin (A {\textless} C). Overall, our results demonstrate that
              B. napus
              accumulates a large number of genetic changes, but these rearrangements are not randomly distributed in the genome. The structural genetic diversity produced by the allohaploid pathway and its role in the evolution of polyploid species compared to diploid meiosis are discussed.},

                Albertin

              suggest an autotetraploid origin of 10 tetraploid strains of baker’s yeast (
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              ), supported by the frequent observation of double reduction meiospores. However, the presented inheritance results were puzzling and seemed to contradict the authors’ interpretation that segregation ratios support a tetrasomic model of inheritance. Here, we provide an overview of the expected segregation ratios at the tetrad and meiospore level given scenarios of strict disomic and tetrasomic inheritance, for cases with and without recombination between locus and centromere. We also use a power analysis to derive adequate sample sizes to distinguish alternative models. Closer inspection of the Albertin
              et al.
              data reveals that strict disomy can be rejected in most cases. However, disomic inheritance with strong but imperfect preferential pairing could not be excluded with the sample sizes used. The possibility of tetrad analysis in tetraploid yeast offers a valuable opportunity to improve our understanding of meiosis and inheritance of tetraploids.},

                    First‐generation polyploids often suffer from more meiotic errors and lower fertility than established wild polyploid populations. One such example is the allopolyploid model species
                    Arabidopsis suecica
                    which originated
                    c.
                    16 000 generations ago.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We present here a comparison of meiosis and its outcomes in naturally evolved and first‐generation ‘synthetic’
                    A. suecica
                    using a combination of cytological and genomic approaches.
                  
                
                
                  We show that while meiosis in natural lines is largely diploid‐like, synthetic lines have high levels of meiotic errors including incomplete synapsis and nonhomologous crossover formation. Whole‐genome re‐sequencing of progeny revealed 20‐fold higher levels of homoeologous exchange and eightfold higher aneuploidy originating from synthetic parents. Homoeologous exchanges showed a strong distal bias and occurred predominantly in genes, regularly generating novel protein variants. We also observed that homoeologous exchanges can generate megabase scale INDELs when occurring in regions of inverted synteny. Finally, we observed evidence of sex‐specific differences in adaptation to polyploidy with higher success in reciprocal crosses to natural lines when synthetic plants were used as the female parent.

                    with their genomic outcomes, demonstrating that homoeologous crossovers underlie genomic instability in neo‐allopolyploids and are more distally biased than homologous crossovers.},

            Polyploids are organisms whose genomes consist of more than two complete sets of chromosomes. Both autopolyploids and allopolyploids may display polysomic inheritance. A peculiarity of polysomic inheritance is multivalent formation during meiosis resulting in double-reduction, which occurs when sister chromatid fragments segregate into the same gamete. Double-reduction can result in gametes carrying identical-by-descent alleles and slightly increasing homozygosity. This will cause the genotypic frequencies to deviate from expected values and will thus bias the results of standard population genetic analytical methods used in molecular ecology and selective breeding. In this study, we extend existing double-reduction models to account for any even level of ploidy, and derive the symbolic expressions for genotypic frequencies via two methods. Inbreeding coefficients and heterozygosity under double-reduction and inbreeding are also calculated. Numerical solutions obtained by computer simulations are compared with analytical solutions predicted by the model to validate the model.},

            A leading hypothesis for the evolutionary function of sex postulates that sex is an adaptation that purges deleterious mutations from the genome, thereby increasing the equilibrium mean fitness of a sexual population relative to its asexual competitor. This hypothesis requires two necessary conditions: first, the mutation rate per genome must be of order one, and, second, multiple mutations within a genome must act with positive epistasis, that is, two or more mutations of different genes must be more harmful together than if they acted independently. Here, by reconsidering the theory of mutation-selection balance at a single diploid gene locus, we demonstrate a significant advantage of sex due to nearly recessive mutations provided the mutation rate per genome is of order one. The assumption of positive epistasis is unnecessary, and multiple mutations may be assumed to act independently.},

            The best known genes of microbes, mice and men are those that specify enzymes. Wild type, mutant and heterozygote for variants of such genes differ in the catalytic activity at the step in the enzyme network specified by the gene in question. The effect on the respective phenotypes of such changes in catalytic activity, however, is not defined by the enzyme change as estimated by in vitro determination of the activities obtained from the extracts of the three types. In vivo enzymes do not act in isolation, but are kinetically linked to other enzymes via their substrates and products. These interactions modify the effect of enzyme variation on the phenotype, depending on the nature and quantity of the other enzymes present. An output of such a system, say a flux, is therefore a systemic property, and its response to variation at one locus must be measured in the whole system. This response is best described by the sensitivity coefficient, Z, which is defined by the fractional change in flux over the fractional change in enzyme activity.},

            That random mating leads to Hardy-Weinberg distribution of genotypes is well known. This report is to show that, if the deviations from random mating are of a certain pattern, the offspring generation will also be in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. This brings out the fact that random mating is a sufficient condition, not a necessary one, for the attainment of the Hardy-Weinberg proportions. Such nonrandom-mating populations are tentatively said to be pseudo-random mating. Pseudo-random-mating populations exist for both autosomal and sex-linked systems with two or multiple alleles. This report covers the basic case of a two-allele autosomal locus in detail, but the possible extension to two loci and cytonuclear systems have also been mentioned in discussion.},

            Many bioinformatics pipelines include tests for equilibrium. Tests for diploids are well studied and widely available, but extending these approaches to autopolyploids is hampered by the presence of double reduction, the comigration of sister chromatid segments into the same gamete during meiosis. Though a hindrance for equilibrium tests, double reduction rates are quantities of interest in their own right, as they provide insights about the meiotic behavior of autopolyploid organisms. Here, we develop procedures to (i) test for equilibrium while accounting for double reduction, and (ii) estimate the double reduction rate given equilibrium. To do so, we take two approaches: a likelihood approach, and a novel U-statistic minimization approach that we show generalizes the classical equilibrium χ2 test in diploids. For small sample sizes and uncertain genotypes, we further develop a bootstrap procedure based on our U-statistic to test for equilibrium. We validate our methods on both simulated and real data.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. While the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. Here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. We present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4\% of speciation events in flowering plants and 7\% in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.},
